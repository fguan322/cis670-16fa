# Questions

- In Exercise 11.2, the author says, 'The essence of Hoare's mistake is the
  misidentification of the type œÑ opt with the type bool √ó œÑ. ... The idea is
  that the flag indicates whether the associated value is 'present'.' I
  understand that this presents a problem. But if the value is always 'present'
  irrespective of what the flag indicates and is used only when the the flag is
  true, would there still be some problem? More generally, can œÑ‚ÇÅ + œÑ‚ÇÇ be
  replaced by ùîπ √ó œÑ‚ÇÅ √ó œÑ‚ÇÇ and the corresponding definitions appropriately
  modified and can this be done for any finite sum with a suitable replacement
  for ùîπ?

  [SCW: If the value is always present then there is no problem, and the bool
  is unnecessary.  You are also right that any sum "t1 + t2" can be replaced by
  "bool * t1 * t2", or if you have dependent types and want to save space
  "Sigma b:Bool, if b then t1 else t2"]

- For the nullify sum, the typing rule says that when e is void type, then
  abort(e) will be of type tau. Does it mean that we could define any type to
  abort(e) expression? Also for the case rule, the book says that two branches
  should return expressions with the same type. It is only for the language
  which is type safe? And it would be great if the proof of safety can be
  proved during the class.

- I see the resemblance with how we implemented Bool, and Maybe, and finite
  enumerations. Say we wanted to make a list type. Would adding product types be
  enough to get our ADTs? Or do we need some sort of recursive type?

  Does this work?
  
            Exp e := node
                     Cons (e1,e2)

            t list = t + (t, t list)
                    node = l . e
                    cons(e1, e2) = r (e1, e2)

  [SCW: you do need a recursive type to have recursive ADTs]

- I can see the coherence between product types and `struct`s in C. Is there
such coherence between sum types and C `union`s?  If yes, since we can
simulate `union`s with `struct`s in C, can we also simulate sum types with
product types?

# August 30, 2016

To Read: Chapters 1,2 & 4 of PFPL
To Do:
- Install Coq and Metalib
- Complete [Ch4.v](../code/Ch4.v)

## Introduction and course goals
--------------------------------
Goal: extend & deepen knowledge of programming language theory and types 
Provide a firm foundation for the sorts of proofs that appear in PL research
papers, such as in POPL and ICFP.

Focus: *type abstraction* and *equality* in typed lambda calculi

References: Bob Harper's Practical Foundations for Programming Languages
(possibly) Appel's Verified Functional Algorithms

Nonfocus: program verification, dependent types


## Background 
-------------

Everyone in here should either be a PhD student or have taken CIS 500.  In
general, we expect that you have experience with functional programming (OCaml
or ML), and have seen a type safety proof for simply-typed lambda calculus.

Although we'll start with some mechanical proofs in Coq, Coq experience is
useful but *not required*.

Who here has:
- taken CIS 500 at Penn?
- self-studied SF (or as part of a class)?
- taken another course on PL theory?
- Used Coq before?

## What you should expect this semester
---------------------------------------

+ If you are taking this class for a grade
- Come to every class prepared (I'll announce the reading for the next class
  ahead of time)
- You *must* send me 1-2 questions the morning before each class (via email)
- Be prepared to give one lecture this semester on a chapter in PFPL
- A few homework assignments at the beginning of the semester to make sure
  everyone is up to speed
- Semester project (in groups) to go deeper on a particular topic
   * replicate the proofs in a classic paper (by hand or in Coq)
   * extend a classic paper with a new feature
   * some other exploration

+ If you are auditing this semester
- Come to every class prepared (I'll announce the reading for the next class
  ahead of time)
- Send me 1-2 questions before each class 
  

## First topic: Working with a model of a simple, typed programming language

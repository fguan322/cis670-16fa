Topic: Constructive Logic

# Questions

- After reading chapter 12, I feel confused about the representation of proof
  dynamics. First, why we use definitional equations. Does it imply it is a
  bidirectional relation? Moreover, in the disjunction rule, why should we
  have those premises? Moreover, in language E and T, there is safety
  properties. Is there any property about constructive logic? Another thing is
  that in programming language, we do type check by apply static rule. In
  constructive logic, since a type is a proposition and a proof is a value of
  a proposition. Does it mean that checking the correctness of a proof is a
  process of type checking? Last but not least, it would be great if you could
  talk about you idea of relation between computation and logic
  proof(including similarity and difference).

- Is there any way to use the propositions as types principle to extract a
  small-step operational semantics, rather than the equational semantics
  presented in the chapter? Ideally we would like to be able to say something
  about how the language evaluates.

- How do we show that a proposition is refutable? In particular, can we (and
  how can we) show that a proposition is refutable using the proof terms given
  in 12.2.2?
